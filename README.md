Gradient Descent Cars
=====================

A gradient descent car evolver in HTML5 canvas.

The original implementation was inspired by BoxCar2D, and uses the same physics engine, Box2D, but was written from scratch. This implementation is largely based on the original, and contains a large amount of the original code.

This is the code as published on <a href="http://j3rn.com/genetic_cars_2/">on my personal website</a>.
The original version can be found <a href="http://rednuht.org/genetic_cars_2/">on this site</a>.

## Disclaimer

My version is considerably slower than the original. After extensive code review and performance profiling, I still have no idea why this is. If you do, please help me.
